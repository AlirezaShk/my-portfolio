                            Information table stored the title and description
                            of every entry in any part of the project and other
                            tables would get their info using info_id as a
                            foreign key; this was set so the title and
                            description of a medium or that of a user account,
                            wouldnâ€™t be returned in a query call (hence
                            increasing the speed of queries using appropriate
                            search indexes) for a medium info especially when
                            some of the searching/sorting algorithms were not
                            looking for a string clause.

                    Switchable themes and color pallettes were designed. Some of
                    them were only togglable by the admin and some of these
                    themes (like light and dark for day/night mode) were
                    selectable by each user for themselves.

                    Developed and tested a suggestable media finder algorithm
                    for each user; it basically assigned a weight to a medium
                    that the user had watched/liked/shared/favorited/saved after
                    taking into consideration the userâ€™s liked & blacklisted
                    categories. Then sorted the weighted list and stored the
                    suggestable content for later procedures in the database.

                    Search system across all these mediums with all these
                    categories and specific search parameters for each medium
                    type was totally developed and designed by me. This was a
                    complicated task and I decided to replicate the logic of SQL
                    queries but with a more graphical interactive interface for
                    the general user. The code was based in Javascript/JQuery.

                    Since the web app was to handle so many huge files, it was
                    unnecessary to store these media resources on the server of
                    the application itself; therefore, another server
                    specifically dedicated to store and retrieval of the files
                    was secured and the backend was written in Golang. These two
                    servers communicated with each other through APIs.
